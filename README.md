# TokenFriend_Finhacks_Hackathon

This is a small Android application that my team and I built for the Finhacks hackathon 2016 sponsored
by TD and Cisco Systems. This application is called Token Friend, it allows you to generate and scan
custom QR codes. The idea behind this application was to use the QR codes as a way to transfer small amounts
of money between you and another person. Th application would act as a virtual wallet and only hold a small amount of money,
once a code has been generated your friend will scan ths code with their phone through this app and the money would appear instantly
in your wallet. After the code has been generated it is only active for 5mins if not scanned within this time the code
will disappear and you will have generate a new one.

Langauages Used:

Platform: Android
Programming Language: Java
QR Code: Zebra Crossing, A ZXing Project that exists to provide an open source barcode scanner for a range of devices.
Server: Spring framework that links to the server
